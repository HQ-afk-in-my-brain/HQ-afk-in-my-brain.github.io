## Academics

I enjoy reading literature and reading about theories of literature. I am currently enrolled in **ENGL 396!** I hope to become
a technical writer when I graduate.

Here is a list of some of my favourite classes:
- ENGL 396 with Chris Holstrom <3<3 [https://english.washington.edu/courses/2025/spring/engl/396/a]
- ENGL 304 with Henry Staten [https://english.washington.edu/courses/2020/spring/engl/304/a]
- ENGL 335 with Charles La Porte and Jesse Oak Taylor [https://english.washington.edu/courses/2024/autumn/engl/335/a]

## Favourite works read so far

I am relatively new to programming, having only taken one programming class (CSE 121 with Matt Wang <3<3) and so
can't write all that much about it. Instead, here are some of the favourite books I've read through my coursework

| Book | Description |
|---------:|------------|
| Wide Sargasso Sea   | A fanfic turned literary canon    |
|  Ted Chiang: Stories of your Life     | Short Story Sci Fi collection from a fellow technical writer!    |
|  Middlemarch     | A book that I have decided I will revisit every decade       |
